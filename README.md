# PIV-FlowDiffuser
This repository includes the code for the paper _PIV-FlowDiffuser: Transfer-learning-based diffusion models for particle image velocimetry_. In this work, a model incorporating diffusion denoising is utilized to make the PIV optical flow prediction more accurate. The transfer learning method is employed, which significantly reduces the model training cost.
